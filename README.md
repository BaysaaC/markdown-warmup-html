### You can always count on me when...

- you bring the ca$h, bab€ ! *(I'm joking)*
- Google won't be your friend ;(
- you need some basic PowerPoint-related tips
- you need someone to talk to without fearing of being judged 


### *And now, a little funny story ...*

When I was a kid, while playing around with other kids, I ran into a window (hidden behind blind shutters) and broke it. 

When asked by the school director, I then pretended I slipped and crashed accidentally.

#### TL;DR:

Don't run into windows, kiddos !
